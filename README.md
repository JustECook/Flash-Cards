# Flash-Cards
A prototype of using flash cards to study.

Purpose of Build:

Studying can be difficult or even boring. But these flash cards can help with that. Let's pretend someone is learning their numbers in English. A user can input the English spelling in the provided text box. The flash card will turn green if the answer is correct. Otherwise, the card will be red.

Updates:

1. Added 4 more cards making 10 total
2. Cards now turn back to default blue when entries are cleared

Potential Future Updates:

1. Add timer and point system
2. Flash cards change order everytime page is refreshed
3. Reset button to clear entries.
