# Flash-Cards
A prototype of using flash cards to study.

Purpose of Build:

Study can be difficult but these flash cards will help. Let's pretend someone is learning their numbers in English. A user can input the English spelling
in the provided text box. The flash card will turn green if the answer is correct. Otherwise, the card will be red.

User feedback is always appreciated.
